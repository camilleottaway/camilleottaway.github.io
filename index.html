            Hi! I'm Camille. I'm passionate about equity and innovation in STEAM education. 
            I'm a people person, and believe a sense of belonging
            is important in classrooms, communities, teams, and families.
            I strive to make people feel they belong by listening, finding common ground,
            and modeling kindness. I enjoy meeting new people and learning new moves
            at local swing and lindy hop dances.
